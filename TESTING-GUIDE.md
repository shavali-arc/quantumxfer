# QuantumXfer Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for testing QuantumXfer Enterprise SSH/SFTP functionality using a local WSL Ubuntu server.

## Quick Setup Summary

### 1. WSL Ubuntu SSH Server Setup
Since WSL is already running, execute these commands in Ubuntu:

```bash
# Update system and install SSH server
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install openssh-server -y

# Start SSH service
sudo service ssh start
sudo systemctl enable ssh

# Create test users
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash testuser
echo "testuser:test123" | sudo chpasswd

sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash quantumuser
echo "quantumuser:quantum123" | sudo chpasswd

# Create test environment
sudo -u testuser bash -c "
mkdir -p /home/testuser/{Documents,Downloads,Scripts,Logs,TestFiles}
echo 'Hello from QuantumXfer SSH Test Server!' > /home/testuser/Documents/welcome.txt
echo '#!/bin/bash\necho Test script executed successfully' > /home/testuser/Scripts/test.sh
chmod +x /home/testuser/Scripts/test.sh
dd if=/dev/zero of=/home/testuser/Downloads/testfile.bin bs=1M count=5
echo '\$(date): SSH test server initialized' > /home/testuser/Logs/server.log
"

# Get WSL IP address
hostname -I
```

### 2. Test Connection from Windows
```powershell
# Test SSH connection
ssh testuser@localhost
# Enter password: test123

# Test SFTP
sftp testuser@localhost
```

## QuantumXfer Testing Scenarios

### Test Configuration 1: Basic User
```
Host: localhost
Port: 22
Username: testuser
Password: test123
Profile Name: WSL Test Server
```

### Test Configuration 2: Quantum User
```
Host: localhost
Port: 22
Username: quantumuser
Password: quantum123
Profile Name: WSL Quantum User
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. SSH Connection Refused
```bash
# Check if SSH service is running
sudo service ssh status

# Start SSH service if stopped
sudo service ssh start
```

#### 2. Authentication Failed
```bash
# Reset user password
sudo passwd testuser
# Enter new password when prompted
```

#### 3. WSL Network Issues
```powershell
# Restart WSL from Windows
wsl --shutdown
wsl -d Ubuntu-24.04
```

#### 4. Permission Denied
```bash
# Check SSH configuration
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# Ensure PasswordAuthentication yes

# Restart SSH service
sudo service ssh restart
```

### Debug Commands

#### Check SSH Server Status
```bash
# SSH service status
sudo systemctl status ssh

# Check if SSH port is listening
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :22

# View SSH logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log
```

#### Network Diagnostics
```bash
# Get WSL IP addresses
ip addr show
hostname -I

# Test local SSH connection
ssh testuser@localhost
ssh testuser@127.0.0.1
```

## Advanced Testing Scenarios

### 1. Large File Transfers
Create test files of various sizes:
```bash
# Create test files in testuser's Downloads
sudo -u testuser bash -c "
cd /home/testuser/Downloads
dd if=/dev/zero of=test_1MB.bin bs=1M count=1
dd if=/dev/zero of=test_10MB.bin bs=1M count=10
dd if=/dev/zero of=test_100MB.bin bs=1M count=100
"
```

### 2. Directory Structure Testing
```bash
# Create complex directory structure
sudo -u testuser bash -c "
mkdir -p /home/testuser/TestProject/{src,docs,tests,assets/{images,videos,audio}}
touch /home/testuser/TestProject/src/{main.js,utils.js,config.json}
touch /home/testuser/TestProject/docs/{README.md,API.md}
touch /home/testuser/TestProject/tests/{unit.test.js,integration.test.js}
"
```

### 3. Permission Testing
```bash
# Create files with different permissions
sudo -u testuser bash -c "
touch /home/testuser/readonly.txt
chmod 444 /home/testuser/readonly.txt

touch /home/testuser/executable.sh
chmod 755 /home/testuser/executable.sh

touch /home/testuser/hidden_file
"
```

### 4. Symlink Testing
```bash
# Create symbolic links
sudo -u testuser bash -c "
ln -s /home/testuser/Documents/welcome.txt /home/testuser/welcome_link.txt
ln -s /home/testuser/Scripts /home/testuser/scripts_link
"
```

## Legacy Testing Methods (Pre-SSH Implementation)

### 1. Web Development Testing (Recommended for Development)
npm run build

# Preview the built application
npm run preview
```

**Expected Output**:
```
‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:4173/
‚ûú  Network: use --host to expose
```

**Testing Actions**:
1. Open browser to `http://localhost:4173/`
2. Verify the production build loads correctly
3. Check for any missing assets or broken functionality
4. Compare with development version for consistency

### 3. Electron Desktop Application Testing

**Purpose**: Test the complete desktop application experience.

#### 3a. Development Mode (if configured)
```bash
# Start Electron in development mode (if available)
npm run electron:dev
```

#### 3b. Production Package Testing (Recommended)
```bash
# Build the production packages
npm run build
./build.bat  # Windows
# or
./build.sh   # Linux

# Test the Windows package
cd "dist-packager\QuantumXfer Enterprise-win32-x64"
.\QuantumXfer Enterprise.exe

# Test the Linux package (on Linux)
cd "dist-packager/QuantumXfer Enterprise-linux-x64"
./QuantumXfer Enterprise
```

**Testing Actions**:
1. Verify the application launches without errors
2. Check that the splash screen appears and disappears correctly
3. Confirm the main UI loads and displays properly
4. Test all menu items and shortcuts
5. Verify window resizing and minimizing/maximizing
6. Test application closing and reopening

### 4. Download and Install Testing

**Purpose**: Test the end-user installation experience.

**Steps**:
```bash
# Create test directory
mkdir QuantumXfer-Test
cd QuantumXfer-Test

# Download latest release (replace URL with actual release)
curl -L -o QuantumXfer-Enterprise-Windows-x64.zip "https://github.com/shavali-arc/quantumxfer/releases/download/v1.0.2/QuantumXfer-Enterprise-Windows-x64.zip"

# Extract and test
unzip QuantumXfer-Enterprise-Windows-x64.zip
cd "QuantumXfer Enterprise-win32-x64"
.\QuantumXfer Enterprise.exe
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Blank Screen on Startup
**Cause**: Asset path problems in Electron
**Solution**: Verify `vite.config.ts` has `base: './'` configuration

### Issue: Development Server Won't Start
**Cause**: Port already in use
**Solution**: Kill existing processes or use different port

### Issue: Build Fails
**Cause**: TypeScript errors or missing dependencies
**Solution**: Run `npm install` and fix any TypeScript errors

### Issue: Electron App Won't Launch
**Cause**: Missing Node modules or incorrect build
**Solution**: Rebuild with `npm run build` and repackage

## Performance Testing

### Memory Usage
```bash
# Monitor memory usage during runtime
tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq QuantumXfer Enterprise.exe"
```

### Startup Time
- Measure time from launch to UI ready
- Should be under 3-5 seconds for production build

### File Operations
- Test file browsing responsiveness
- Verify smooth scrolling in file lists

## Automated Testing (Future)

Consider adding:
- Unit tests for React components
- Integration tests for Electron main process
- End-to-end tests with Playwright or similar
- Performance benchmarks

## Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, include:
1. Operating system and version
2. Node.js version
3. Exact steps to reproduce
4. Expected vs actual behavior
5. Console error messages
6. Screenshots if applicable

## Success Criteria

A successful test session should demonstrate:
1. ‚úÖ Clean application startup
2. ‚úÖ Functional user interface
3. ‚úÖ Proper window management
4. ‚úÖ No console errors
5. ‚úÖ Smooth user interactions
6. ‚úÖ Clean application shutdown
